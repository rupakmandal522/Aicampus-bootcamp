We are at the end of this module. In this module, we learned about Unix, Git, and Github. 
It's strongly recommended that you take some time to review all the concepts and write blogpost(s) covering everything you learnt. 
You will eventually be publishing your posts on your own blog. However for now, you can write the blogpost at either Medium, dev.to, or Hashnode(Links given below).
