<h2> <b> Experience </b></h2> 


<h3> Senior Front End Developer</h3>

<P> <i> She had been told time and time again that the most important steps were the first and the last. 
    It was something that she carried within her in everything she did, but then he showed up and disrupted everything.
     He told her that she had it wrong. The first step wasn't the most important. The last step wasn't the most important. 
     It was the next step that was the most important. </i></P>
